    <h2>Tips to know before you adopt a puppyüê∂</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>
        Create space and make sure you have toys to enrich them: <strong>puppies need space to play, and toys to keep them occupied</strong> .
        Provide somewhere for your puppy to rest: <strong>this could be a cosy crate, hiding place or bed in a quiet, draught-free place where your puppy can sleep, undisturbed</strong>.
        Take a blanket from the puppy‚Äôs first home ‚Äì bring this back with you so they have something familiar and comfortable to snuggle in.
        Remove anything <strong> <em>poisonous</em> </strong> or that you don‚Äôt want them chewing.
        Find a <em>VET</em> ‚Äì you can always find a local vet in your area or visit us in Grassy Park and our vets will happily assist you.
        Arrange for puppy training classes to set your pup up for success ‚Äì these can get booked up, so find a class and sign up as soon as you know you‚Äôre getting a puppy.
        By the time your puppy comes home with you, they should have:<strong> had their first puppy vaccination, started potty training, been introduced to new situations and people.</strong>
